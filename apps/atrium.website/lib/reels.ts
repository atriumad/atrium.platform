// ─── Reel delivery ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// The CDN holds the edit bay's delivery copies of every reel: 1080x1920 at
// ~19 Mbps, which is 17 MB for seven seconds. `apps/atrium.cdn` transcodes
// those into a `web/` folder beside each source and records what it produced
// in `reels.manifest.json`; this maps a source URL onto that variant.
//
// A reel only appears in the manifest once its variant is on disk, so anything
// not listed keeps its original URL — a partial encode run thins the savings,
// it never points the site at a 404.
