/** Portrait diameter. Fixed in one place because it is the whole argument for
 *  this treatment: at 56px a 400px crop off LinkedIn and a magazine frame are

 *  nobody here controls. Grow this and the mismatch comes back. */

/** The evidence rail: operator quotes running past on a loop.
 *
 *  It is a marquee rather than a grid because the set grows with every client.
 *  A grid has to be re-balanced each time a quote is added — the row either
 *  fills or leaves a hole — while a rail takes any number of cards and asks
 *  nothing of their count.
 *
 *  The loop is the same one the logo strip runs: two copies of the set inside
 *  an overflow window, translated by exactly half the track. The seam is
 *  invisible because the second copy starts where the first began. Only the
 *  first copy is read by assistive tech; the clone carries `aria-hidden`, or a
 *  screen reader announces every quote twice.
 *
 *  The quote is the card and the face is a token beside the name. An earlier
 *  pass ran the photographs full bleed, and the trouble with that was never the
 *  layout: the portraits arrive from press pages, phones and LinkedIn, and at
 *  any size where a face reads as a face, the differences in resolution,
 *  lighting and crop read too. Demoting the portrait is what lets a client send
 *  whatever they have.
 *
 *  Cream cards on the section's dark ground, which is the card vocabulary the
 *  rest of the page already uses — the rail borrows it rather than introducing
 *  a fourth kind of card to the home page. */
