// one is a picture with a caption strip carrying its stage colour at rest, so
// the three stages are coded the moment the section is seen. Hover is left to
// do one job: open the strip to the copy underneath.
//
// The serif accent falls on the verb here, against the site's usual habit of
// stressing the second half. All three cards end in "Demand", so italicising
// that would mark the one word the three have in common; the verb is what
// separates them, and the stress belongs on whatever carries the meaning.
